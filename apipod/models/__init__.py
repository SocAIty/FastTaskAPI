"""Declarative model loading: include handles + the Model base class.

``include`` / ``include_hf`` declare where bytes live (no download at import);
``Model`` subclasses define how to load and use them. The platform reads the
declarations (``apipod scan``) to pick the fastest shipping strategy per
provider (RunPod HF cache, image baking) and the runtime loads everything at
app start (lazy thread-safe fallback on first use).
